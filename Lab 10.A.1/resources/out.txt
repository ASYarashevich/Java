though, by your smiling, you seem to say so.
man delights not me; no, nor woman neither,
And yet to me, what is this quintessence of dust?
the paragon of animals!
the beauty of the world!
in apprehension how like a god!
in action how like an angel!
in form, in moving, how express and admirable!
How infinite in faculty!
How noble in reason!
What a piece of work is a man!
